# **Plant and Human Pain**
I think, like modern biologists, that plants feel pain. They found out that plants secrete substances that suppress it and react to anesthetics like animals and people.
In my works, I show plants unconventionally beautiful: painful, dying, dead. I compare the external manifestations of their illnesses and deaths with the bodily suffering and dying of people. Thus, I try to find common ground between the tragic side of plant and human existence.
